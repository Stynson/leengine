# BGFX

We use a prebuilt libs here:

- bgfx commit `6660e79998df9051e80278ac38be1c4ef35539ea`
- bx commit `010b472f69df675fbe7c3770105fb3033ef038c0`
- bimg commit `cbd18af2abba070cc0cb6e1dd2f0420e4a2e6cee`

We have minor changes in headers to put everything into one include folder because we only need C99 headers.
